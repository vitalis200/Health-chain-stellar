# Coordinator Contract

The coordinator is the integration hub. It holds references to the requests, inventory, and payments contracts and enforces the canonical three-step delivery workflow. No blood unit can be delivered and no payment can be released without passing through this contract.

## Public functions

### initialize

```rust
pub fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    request_contract: Address,
    inventory_contract: Address,
    payment_contract: Address,
) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
```

One-time setup. Stores the admin address and the three domain contract addresses. Emits `(coord, init, v1)` event. Returns `AlreadyInitialized` if called again.

---

### allocate_units

```rust
pub fn allocate_units(
    env: Env,
    request_id: u64,
    unit_ids: Vec<u64>,
    payment_id: u64,
    caller: Address,
) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
```

Step 1 of the workflow.

- Requires `caller` auth.
- Verifies the request exists and is `Pending`.
- Verifies each blood unit exists and is `Available`, then marks it `Reserved`.
- Creates a `WorkflowRecord` with status `Allocated`.
- Emits `(coord, alloc, v1)` with `(request_id, unit_count)`.

Fails if the contract is paused or a workflow for this `request_id` already exists in a non-Pending state.

---

### confirm_delivery

```rust
pub fn confirm_delivery(
    env: Env,
    request_id: u64,
    caller: Address,
    location: String,
) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
```

Step 2 of the workflow.

- Requires `caller` auth.
- Workflow must be `Allocated`.
- Transitions each unit: `Reserved → InTransit`, then `InTransit → Delivered` (via `mark_delivered`).
- Sets `delivery_confirmed = true` and stores `delivery_location`.
- Emits `(coord, dlvrd, v1)` with `(request_id, location)`.

Blocked by both `pause()` and `emergency_halt()`.

---

### settle_payment

```rust
pub fn settle_payment(
    env: Env,
    request_id: u64,
    caller: Address,
) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
```

Step 3 of the workflow.

- Requires `caller` auth.
- Workflow must be `Delivered` with `delivery_confirmed == true`.
- Payment must be `Locked`; transitions it to `Released`.
- Emits `(coord, settld, v1)` with `(request_id, payment_id)`.

Blocked by both `pause()` and `emergency_halt()`.

---

### rollback

```rust
pub fn rollback(env: Env, request_id: u64) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
```

Admin-only. Reverses an in-flight workflow.

- Returns all allocated units to `Available`.
- If the payment is `Locked`, transitions it to `Refunded`. Other payment states are left unchanged.
- Sets workflow status to `RolledBack`.
- Emits `(coord, rollbk, v1)` with `request_id`.

Returns `CannotRollbackSettled` if the workflow has already settled.

---

### flag_temperature_breach

```rust
pub fn flag_temperature_breach(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    payment_id: u64,
    excursion_summary: ExcursionSummary,
) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
```

Called by the temperature contract when a sustained excursion is detected.

- Requires `caller` auth (must be a whitelisted oracle or admin on the temperature contract side).
- Payment must be `Locked`; calls `payments.record_dispute(TemperatureExcursion)`.
- Emits `(coord, tmp_brch)` with `(payment_id, unit_id, timestamp)`.

---

### pause / unpause

```rust
pub fn pause(env: Env, admin: Address) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
pub fn unpause(env: Env, admin: Address) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
pub fn is_paused(env: Env) -> bool
```

Admin-only circuit breaker. Blocks `allocate_units`, `confirm_delivery`, `settle_payment`, and `rollback`.

---

### emergency_halt / clear_emergency_halt

```rust
pub fn emergency_halt(env: Env, admin: Address) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
pub fn clear_emergency_halt(env: Env, admin: Address) -> Result<(), CoordinatorError>
pub fn is_emergency_halted(env: Env) -> bool
```

Admin-only. Unlike `pause()`, the emergency halt only blocks `confirm_delivery` and `settle_payment` — it does not block new allocations. Designed for active incident containment (e.g. compromised oracle). Emits `(coord, emrghlt, v1)` on activation.

---

### get_workflow

```rust
pub fn get_workflow(env: Env, request_id: u64) -> Result<WorkflowRecord, CoordinatorError>
```

Returns the `WorkflowRecord` for a request. Returns `WorkflowNotFound` if no workflow exists.

---

### is_initialized

```rust
pub fn is_initialized(env: Env) -> bool
```

Returns `true` if `initialize()` has been called.

## Types

### WorkflowRecord

```rust
pub struct WorkflowRecord {
    pub request_id: u64,
    pub payment_id: u64,
    pub unit_ids: Vec<u64>,
    pub status: WorkflowStatus,
    pub delivery_confirmed: bool,
    pub delivery_location: Option<String>,
}
```

### WorkflowStatus

```rust
pub enum WorkflowStatus {
    Pending,
    Allocated,
    Delivered,
    Settled,
    RolledBack,
}
```

### ExcursionSummary

```rust
pub struct ExcursionSummary {
    pub unit_id: u64,
    pub violation_count: u32,
    pub peak_celsius_x100: i32,
    pub detected_at: u64,
}
```
