# Requests Contract

Manages hospital blood requests from creation through fulfillment or cancellation. Maintains a full history of every status transition with actor, reason, and accounting details. Integrates with the inventory contract to release reservations on cancellation or rejection.

## Request lifecycle

```
create_request()
      │
      ▼
  Pending ──► Approved ──► InProgress ──► Fulfilled  (terminal)
      │           │
      │           │ partial_fulfill_request()
      │           ▼
      │       InProgress ──► Fulfilled  (terminal)
      │
      ├──► Rejected  (terminal, from Pending or Approved)
      │
      └──► Cancelled (terminal, from Pending, Approved, or InProgress)
```

Only authorized hospitals can create requests. Only the admin can approve, reject, or fulfill. Either the owning hospital or the admin can cancel.

## Public functions

### initialize

```rust
pub fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    inventory_contract: Address,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

One-time setup. Sets the admin, links the inventory contract, initializes the request counter, and authorizes the admin as the first hospital. Returns `AlreadyInitialized` if called again.

---

### authorize_hospital / revoke_hospital

```rust
pub fn authorize_hospital(env: Env, hospital: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
pub fn revoke_hospital(env: Env, hospital: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Admin-only. Grants or revokes hospital authorization. Only authorized hospitals can create requests.

---

### create_request

```rust
pub fn create_request(
    env: Env,
    hospital: Address,
    blood_type: BloodType,
    component: BloodComponent,
    quantity_ml: u32,
    urgency: Urgency,
    required_by_timestamp: u64,
) -> Result<u64, ContractError>
```

Creates a new blood request in `Pending` status. `hospital` must be authorized.

- `required_by_timestamp` must be in the future.
- `quantity_ml` must be positive.
- Records an initial history entry.
- Returns the new request ID.
- Emits `request_created` event.

---

### batch_create_requests

```rust
pub fn batch_create_requests(
    env: Env,
    hospital: Address,
    entries: Vec<(BloodType, BloodComponent, u32, Urgency, u64)>,
) -> Result<Vec<u64>, ContractError>
```

Creates multiple requests in a single transaction. Each tuple is `(blood_type, component, quantity_ml, urgency, required_by_timestamp)`. Returns IDs in input order.

---

### cancel_request

```rust
pub fn cancel_request(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    request_id: u64,
    reason: String,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Cancels a request. `caller` must be the owning hospital or the admin. Request must be in `Pending`, `Approved`, or `InProgress` state. `reason` must be non-empty.

- If a reservation exists on the inventory contract, it is released automatically.
- Records a history entry.
- Emits `request_cancelled` event.

---

### update_request_status

```rust
pub fn update_request_status(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    request_id: u64,
    new_status: RequestStatus,
    reason: String,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Admin-only. Transitions a request to `Approved`, `Rejected`, or `Fulfilled`.

- `Approved`: only from `Pending`.
- `Rejected`: from `Pending` or `Approved`; requires non-empty reason; releases any reservation.
- `Fulfilled`: from `Approved` or `InProgress`; sets `fulfilled_quantity_ml = quantity_ml`.
- `InProgress`, `Pending`, `Cancelled` are not valid targets for this function.

Records a history entry and emits `request_status_updated` event.

---

### partial_fulfill_request

```rust
pub fn partial_fulfill_request(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    request_id: u64,
    fulfilled_delta_ml: u32,
    reason: String,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Admin-only. Records partial fulfillment. Request must be `Approved` or `InProgress`. `fulfilled_delta_ml` cannot exceed the remaining unfulfilled quantity.

- Transitions to `InProgress` if still partially fulfilled, or `Fulfilled` if complete.
- Records a history entry.

---

### get_request

```rust
pub fn get_request(env: Env, request_id: u64) -> Result<BloodRequest, ContractError>
```

Returns the full `BloodRequest` record including history.

---

### get_request_history

```rust
pub fn get_request_history(env: Env, request_id: u64) -> Result<Vec<RequestHistoryEntry>, ContractError>
```

Returns the history entries for a request.

---

### get_requests_by_hospital

```rust
pub fn get_requests_by_hospital(
    env: Env,
    hospital_id: Address,
    page: u32,
    page_size: u32,
) -> Result<Vec<BloodRequest>, ContractError>
```

Returns a paginated slice of requests for a hospital. `page` is zero-indexed. `page_size` is capped at 50.

---

### get_admin / get_inventory_contract / get_request_counter

```rust
pub fn get_admin(env: Env) -> Result<Address, ContractError>
pub fn get_inventory_contract(env: Env) -> Result<Address, ContractError>
pub fn get_request_counter(env: Env) -> Result<u64, ContractError>
```

Read-only accessors.

---

### is_hospital_authorized / is_initialized

```rust
pub fn is_hospital_authorized(env: Env, hospital: Address) -> bool
pub fn is_initialized(env: Env) -> bool
```

Read-only status checks.

---

### get_metadata

```rust
pub fn get_metadata(env: Env) -> Result<ContractMetadata, ContractError>
```

Returns the contract name and version.
